## üß† The Science Behind Dog Vision

### Human Vision (Trichromatic)
- 3 types of cone cells: Red, Green, Blue
- Can perceive millions of colors
- Full color spectrum visibility

### Dog Vision (Dichromatic)
- 2 types of cone cells: Blue and Yellow wavelengths
- Similar to red-green colorblindness in humans
- Limited color discrimination but enhanced other senses

### Color Transformation Algorithm
Our algorithm converts RGB images using a scientifically-based transformation matrix:

1. **RGB to LMS conversion**: Converts to Long, Medium, Short wavelength space
2. **Dichromatic simulation**: Removes red sensitivity
3. **LMS to RGB conversion**: Converts back with enhanced blue-yellow contrast
4. **Realism adjustments**: Fine-tuning for accurate representation
